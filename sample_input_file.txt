This script can produce a reference list consisting of authors’ family names and publication year. You can use the list for comparison of your reference list in the manuscript to know whether you have a mistake in the main text and reference list. I almost always have some problems in my references, but by using the list produced by this script. The correction becomes easier. 

The basic judgement is conducted by 4-digit number starting from 1 or 2, i.e., 1000 or 2017 and that number follows a name-like expressions. 

This script can handle the following text. 
Adam (1910), Baker and Clark (1920) and Davis et al. (1930) studied this. This is recently studied (e.g., Francis et al. 2010a; 2010b). Also Kucieńska et al. [2015] is correctly handled (i.e., non-asci characters and [ ] instead of ( )). 

The combination of month and year, e.g., August 2000 or Jan. 2001, are correctly judged that this is not a reference. 

But of course this simple script is not perfect and cannot correctly extract the reference information for two-word family names, such as, von Neumann (2050), but OK if two words are connected by a hyphen like Evans-Smith (2000). Also, since the judgement based on name-like word plus four digit years, some other cases also can be mistakenly judged as reference information. But the occurrence of these cases are not many, I think (at least to my experiences).
