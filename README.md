# List-up-references
Make a reference list from the main text of a manuscript. The list can be used for manual check of consistency between references in main text and reference list. 

For exapmle, the following list 

Adam 1910 

Baker and Clark 1920

Davis et al. 1930 \n
Evans-Smith 2000
Francis et al. 2010a
Francis et al. 2010b
Kucie≈Ñska et al. 2015
Neumann 2050

is extracted from the "sample_input_file.txt". The extraction is correct except for the last one, which is actually "von Neumann 2050", but the current version ignore "von".
